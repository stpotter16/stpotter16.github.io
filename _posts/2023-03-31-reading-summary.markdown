- "The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Business" by Eric Ries - 
A well known book in some circles. I enjoyed dusting off old knowledge about Lean Manufacturing and seeing it applied to new
software ventures. The portions on batch size and cycle time felt especially relevant to my current work context.
- "Black House" by Peter Straub and Stephen King - The sequel to the "Talisman" follows now grown Jack Sawyer. I read this book
for its loose connection to The Dark Tower series. I found it a challenging and disturbing read, even by the horror standards of these two authors.
- "Flying Blind: The 737 MAX Tragedy and the Fall of Boeing" by Peter Robinson - Traces the history of Boeing from its founding through the mergers
with McDonnell Douglas to the tragedy of the 737 MAX and its faulty MCAS. A sad picture of an engineering organization transformed into
a financial performance organism and the results of metamorphosis. Growing up, Boeing was always a place I "dreamed" of working. I don't think the Boeing
in my mind existed by the time I would have been able to join it.
- "Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of General Electric" by Thomas Gryta and Ted Mann - Similar read to "Flying Blind". It was interesting to cross-reference the
executives mentioned in both books. The cross-pollination of ideas between GE and Boeing was apparent, though it could be argued that Boeing was just trying to
imitate the mighty GE of the 90s.
- "Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success" by Adam Grant - I enjoyed this book. Grant's writing is clear and engaging and I appreciated the amount of
evidence he presented to support his points. However, I had two recurring questions that never felt answered. First, how accurate and precise were the surveys used in
most of the presented studies at determining a person's reciprocity style? Much of the conclusions drawn about the influence of reciprocity style depend on some level of
surety about the ability to accurately categorize the reciprocity style of the subjects. I wish more time had been devoted to examining the methods used to establish the styles.
Second, can a person's reciprocity style change over time? Based on the author's recommendations for actions to increase "giver" behaviors, I _think_ the answer is yes, but
it would have been nice to have seen this question addressed directly.
- "The Dark Tower" by Stephen King - The last book of The Dark Tower cycle. I've been reading this series interspersed with other King stories that relate to it in some way for over two years.
It has been a journey, with this book serving as a fitting and thoroughly satisfying end.
