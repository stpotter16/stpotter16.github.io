# TL;DR
I'm committing to trying a new approach for executing on side projects.

Going forward each side project will have the following:
- A "launch" post describing the what and why of the project
- A set of "kill criteria" ([described](https://behavioralscientist.org/annie-duke-quit-mental-models-to-help-you-cut-your-losses/) by Annie Duke) as a set of tangible metrics on when to walk away from an endeavor
- Weekly posts that layout a set of goals for the project for that week and review progress from last week

# Launch posts
Launch posts don't need to be exhaustive design documents or overly optimistic takes on the potential of a project.

That said, each launch post must include some information on the what and why of that project.

The "what" should have enough detail to be able to define "done", at least in an MVP sense. It's okay to include info about technology choices here, but that's not necessary.

The "why" should give some insight into what I want to get out of the project. Do I want to learn something in particular, experiment with a piece of technology, etc.

# Kill Criteria
Kill criteria must be part of each launch post. They should combine a (state, date) pair that will help guide me toward walking away when appropriate.

# Weekly posts
Weekly posts need to review progress towards the previous week's goals and then set new ones (within the context of the previous week's progress).
I don't expect to be good at setting realistic goals each week (at least initially), but hopefully I'll improve over time.

Regardless, goals should be made a small as reasonably possible.
