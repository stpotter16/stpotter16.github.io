- "Maus: A Survivor's Tale" by Art Spiegelman -
Maus is a graphic novel that tells the story of the author's father, Vladek's, experience of the Holocaust.
I read this book as part of a mini "book club" with my father. Needless to say, it was a challenging read, for reasons I anticipated and for some that surprised me.
Pondering the book, it is so disheartening that the same anti-Semitism that drove much of the Holocaust is still alive and well today.
