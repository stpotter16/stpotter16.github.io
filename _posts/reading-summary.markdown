- "When McKinsey Comes To Town: The Hidden Influences of the World's Most Powerful Consulting Firm" by Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe -
A well researched account of McKinsey and Company's involvement with some unsavory clients of the last century. The book certainly aims to make
your blood boil with the accounts of McKinsey assisting Big Tabacco, authoritarian states, and Purdue Pharma. These attempts were mostly succesful in my case.
What surprised me most was the ease at which McKinsey "played both sides of the table", e.g. advised pharmaceutical companies and the FDA simultaneously.
My one grip, though fair from the author's perspective/purpose for the book, was that there was no attempt to balance accounts of the harms McKinsey had contributed to
with acounts of any benefit their work might have produced.
