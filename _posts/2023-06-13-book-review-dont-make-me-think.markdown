I've never been confident in my user design skills as an engineer so I picked up
Steve Krug's classic "Don't Make Me Think Revisited" in an attempt to expose myself to the
topic in a practical way.

The book did not disappoint. It was funny, concise, and pragmatic. I think it's a book
I'll return to time and time again (it's certainly made it's way into my shopping cart).

I'll summarize the major sections here and give a few of my main takeaways.

# Section: Guiding Principles
The book opens with Krug's core idea that usability is about supporting "mindless" choices for users.

Users don't read every word on a page, rather they scan for what looks like a reasonable next action, then
take it (satisficing).

The job of designers is to support this scanning and satisficing behavior. We can do that by making sure
our pages have a good visual hierarchy, stick to conventions, and are clear about what's clickable and what's not.

# Section: Things You Need To Get Right
Now the book gets more specific.

The site must clearly tell the user "where" they are on the site at all times 
and provide clear means of navigating up and down the site hierarchy.

Sites must also put effort into a good home page experience. That page should do everything it can
to communicate what the site is and what it can do for the user. The tagline is a key part of this.

# Section: Making Sure You Got Them Right
This section is all about usability testing. Why you should do it (no excuses) and how to do it in a scalable way.

Usability testing is about asking a user to try to accomplish a set of tasks on your site and watch them try to do just that. All the while, you're asking them to talk out loud about
what they are thinking about.
It does not need to be "fancy" and DIY user testing can be just as effective and informative as more formal testing. The reality is you're likely not testing enough so
whatever you can do to test more, do it.

Some good resources from this section include:
- A whitepaper on how to recruit users: [https://www.nngroup.com/reports/how-to-recruit-participants-usability-studies/](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/how-to-recruit-participants-usability-studies/)
- A sample script of how to conduct a useability test (and other resources): [https://sensible.com/download-files/](https://sensible.com/download-files/)

# Section: Larger Concerns And Outside Influences
The book closes with thoughts on mobile, usability as a common courtesy, and accessibility.

The principles for mobile aren't really all that different, though there are challenges from the smaller screen size (allow zooming!)
and the lack of affordance because there's no hover. Krug also emphasizes the need for apps to be learnable and memorable.

The chapter on usability as a common courtesy reminds us of the frustrating experiences we've all had with websites that intentionally make it
hard to do what we want to do (hiding information, clicking through forms or promos, etc.). Don't do these things. The site should be a mensch

Finally, the book closes with a chapter on accessibility, though Krug admits this can be a large and confusing topic.
I certainly agree, but I appreciated the four key takeaways that he left:
1. Fix the usability problems that confuse everyone
2. Read an article with a screen reader to see if the article still scans well
3. Read a book ("A Web for Everyone: Designing Accessible User Experiences" by Horton and Quesenebery looks especially good)
4. Pick low-hanging fruit
- Image alt-text
- Use the right heading tags for the right level of content
- Use the label tag so screen readers can understand forms
- Add a "Skip to Main Content" link at the beginning of each page so screen readers don't have to read the nav every time
- Make all content accessible by keyboard
- Make sure text and background have significant contrast
- Make sure the site responds to changes in text size

# My biggest takeaways
The book was chock full of great insights, but the biggest for me were:
1. Users need to know where they are on your site at all times. Breadcrumbs and navigation are hugely important.
2. Users are in a hurry and are scanning as quickly as they can for a reasonable next action. Make that choice brainless.
3. You must, must, _must_ do usability testing. Nothing beats watching users stumble through your design. No excuses here.
