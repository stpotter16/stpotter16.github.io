# Last week's progress
A quick note - I've been on vacation the majority of the last two weeks so my progress has been less than stellar.

# 1. Finish hypermodern python guide
No progress this week :(

# Goals for the week
1. Finish the hypermodern python guide, but be more careful about needs vs wants.
