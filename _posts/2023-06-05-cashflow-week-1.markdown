# Last week's progress
# 1. Setup the project.
    
 Repo is up at https://github.com/stpotter16/cashflow

I made it about halfway through the hypermodern python guide (up through a portion of the linting section).

Some thoughts as I stood this up and went through the hypermodern python guide
- I don't think I really need to support multiple versions of python as this isn't a library, but it probably doesn't hurt (for now).
- I'm not convinced that I should run on the bleeding edge, i.e. 3.10, but might be worth revisiting.
    - I don't know how to do this with poetry. Maybe I just need to update the tool dependency list?

Some things I skipped from the hypermodern python guide
- Using a `src` folder
- All the example `click` CLIs

# 2. Pick a VPS
I'm going to go with [Linode](linode.com). It was a toss up between this and Digital Ocean.
I landed on Linode for now. We'll see if that decision has legs

# Goals for the week
1. Finish the hypermodern python guide.
2. Make a decision about supporting multiple python versions.
