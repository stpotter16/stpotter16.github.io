- "When McKinsey Comes To Town: The Hidden Influences of the World's Most Powerful Consulting Firm" by Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe -
A well researched account of McKinsey and Company's involvement with some unsavory clients over the last century. The book certainly aims to make
your blood boil with the accounts of McKinsey assisting Big Tabacco, authoritarian states, and Purdue Pharma. These attempts were mostly succesful in my case.
What surprised me most was the ease with which McKinsey "played both sides of the table", e.g. advised pharmaceutical companies and the FDA simultaneously.
My one gripe, though fair from the author's perspective/purpose for the book, was that there was no attempt to balance accounts of the harms McKinsey had contributed
with acounts of any benefit their work might have produced.
- "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty" by Patrick Radden Keefe - 
An absorbing, narratively structured report of the Sackler family. The book traces three generations of the Sackler family as they built multiple business
in the pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical adjacent world, culminating in their involvement, via Purdue Pharma, in the release of OxyCotin and the subsequent
opiod crisis. Keefe reports in such a well-paced, compelling style. The book is, no surpise, a sobering read. I sometimes ask myself, "Why read these dreary
frustrating books"? I don't have a great answer. Maybe it's an attempt to witness to injustice (not a single executive of Perdue Pharma or any of the Sackler family admitted guilt or served jail time)?
Maybe I read it in the hopes that I can "see" when goverment fails us (OxyCotin's FDA approver eventually worked for Perdue) and try to advocate for change.
- "What If? 2: Additional Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe -
I've enjoyed xkcd for a long while and enjoyed the first edition of "What If?". Part 2 was no dissapointment.
- "How to: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems" by Randall Munroe -
A great counterpoint to the "What If?" series of books. Light and fun.
- "Don't Make Me Think Revisited: A Common Sense Approah to Web and Mobile Usability" by Steve Krug - full review [here](https://stpotter16.github.io/books/2023/06/13/book-review-dont-make-me-think.html)
