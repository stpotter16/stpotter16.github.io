I don't blog that much, i.e. never.

I think one of the biggest problems for me is that I feel a huge amount of pressure (almost all of which is internal) to make the post "profound" in some undefinable way.

That's unhelpful silliness, I know, but it's the first barrier my brain throws up when I consider sitting down to write.

So, I'm trying to combat that by writting short posts. Ideally, these posts will be things I can bang out in less than an hour.

I'm not the originator of this idea. Much of my inspiration comes from bloggers whose work I admire, particularly Matthew Rocklin's advice to [write short blog posts](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2019/06/25/write-short-blogposts).

So here it goes, the first of what I hope are many short posts to come.

Stick around!

Sam
