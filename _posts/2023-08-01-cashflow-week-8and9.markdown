# Last week's progress

# 1. Finish layout of the "timeline" page
I _think_ I'm basically done here.

I've got the table and the button for adding new transactions. That's good enough to start.

# 2. Start building out the data layer
I didn't make much progress on this beyond figuring out what extensions I want to use, e.g. flask-sqlalchemy.
Started reading some tutorials.

# Goals for the week
1. Finish layout of the "timeline" page.
2. Start building out the data layer.
