# Last week's progress
Quick note - Another double week post due to the holiday in the US.

# 1. Finish hypermodern python guide
Done! I skipped much of the documentation section of the guide as I'm not writing much "public facing" code.
I definitely bookmarked it to come back to though!

# Basic site templating
I've started to rough out the structure of the site and think about individual page layout.

# Goals for the week
1. Finish the structure of the site (what pages will there be).
2. Finish layout of the "timeline" page.
