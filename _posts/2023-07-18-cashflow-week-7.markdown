# Last week's progress

# 1.Finish the structure of the site (what pages will there be).
I _think_ I'm basically done here.

Trying hard to embrace the "KISS" principle so there will only be pages for transactions, accounts, and "categories."

It kinda feels heretical to not have a "budget" page, but budgets don't really seem to change my spending behavior.

Meh, let's see.

# 2. Finish layout of the "timeline" page.
This is mostly done. The "read" portion of displaying the transactions looks okay.

Need to figure out how the "create" part of the proceedings will work.

# Goals for the week
1. Finish layout of the "timeline" page.
2. Start building out the data layer.
