Hi, I'm Sam and this is my ~~loose collection of unrelated thoughts on programming and science~~ blog.

I'm an mechanical engineer turned software developer interested in the intersection of software, science, and engineering.

I have a masters in mechanical engineering from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I did some reaserch in soft tissue biomechanics.

Python is my tool of choice at the moment, but I'm dabbling in JavaScript (because the internet) and C++ (because speed) to better round out my skill set.
