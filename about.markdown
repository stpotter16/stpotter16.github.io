Hi, I'm Sam and this is my ~~loose collection of unrelated thoughts on programming and science~~ blog.

I'm a mechanical engineer turned software developer interested in the intersection of software, science, and engineering.

I have a masters in mechanical engineering from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I did some reaserch in soft tissue biomechanics.

Currently, I'm working as a full-stack engineer at [Indeed](indeed.com). All opinions expressed here are my own.

In my copious free time, I'm hacking away at a few projects.

- A python library for Digital Image Correlation (DIC) written in Python.
- A personal finace app built with NextJS.
